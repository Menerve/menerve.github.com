          <p>
            Several years of development experience during which I contributed to the development of machine learning models and related applications as well as the creation of pipelines. I also supervised interns. The projects to which I contributed: real-time bidding optimization system to display the best digital impression, prediction of the risk of patient readmission and the associated web application, as well as the development of a model for predicting the risk of out of stock items in a healthcare organization.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Key skills</strong> : Python, Node.js, Scala with the help of Bash, SQL, Databricks and React, Flask for SaaS application development. Project deployment: GoCD, Jenkins, Azure Devops, AKS and EKS. Project management : Scrum method and Jira, Git and Confluence.

          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>
                Developed a machine learning model able to predict the probability of stock out of a submitted order from an healthcare organization in order to optimize orders and limit late deliveries. Used Python, Databricks on Azure, Scikit-learn and Kedro.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed shared tools used by Logibec's products enabling features like single sign on, multi tenant, and SaaS on a cloud environment. Developed in Java with Spring Boot on Microsoft Azure.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed a machine learning pipeline supporting a new application predicting the risk of patients’ readmission before being discharged from the hospital. The application technology stack involved Apache Spark with Scala, Postgresql, Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn.
              </li>
              <li>
                Involved in grant applications and coordination between Logibec, clients and academic researchers in order to get federal and provincial public funding for new machine learning projects relevant for healthcare organizations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Managed machine learning interns from Mila who were responsible for analyzing data and developing new models relevant for the clients.
              </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Machine learning specialist</h4>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Responsible for online real-time bidding advertising campaign performance made through Datacratic RTB-Opt product. Making sure campaign managers get the best ROI possible by monitoring machine learning models performance on key metrics (Click-Through Rate, Cost Per Click, Cost Per Acquisition).
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>
                Ensured continuous improvement of the campaign optimization system in order to fit campaign managers needs: enable optimization on small campaigns.
              </li>
              <li>
                Improved the system C++ and Python technology stack in order to support new use cases and improve every day operations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed a machine learning pipeline in Golang using Amazon AWS machine learning and Kubernetes to drive the new audience recognition technology. 
              </li>
          </ul>
